* About
Basically the idea is that a password consisting of "proper" words has
a higher entropy than pseudo-random characters, like for example, a
hash. This means that it is easier to remember *and* harder to crack.
The only problem with this kind of password is coming up with random
words...

This tool takes a file which contains a list of words separated by
newlines, and generates a password separated by underscores.

* Quick setup
#+begin_src console
$ git clone https://github.com/shoumodip/pg
$ cd pg
$ go build pg.go
#+end_src

* Usage
** ~pg FILE~
Generate a password consisting of random words taken from a newline
separated ~FILE~. For an example file, use ~english.txt~ supplied in
this repo.

The number of words in the password will range between ~3~ and
~7~. See the constants ~MIN_WORDS~ and ~MAX_WORDS~ in ~pg.go~.

#+begin_src console
$ ./pg english.txt

$ ./pg english.txt

#+end_src

** ~pg FILE COUNT~
Generate a password consisting of random words taken from a newline
separated ~FILE~. 

The number of words in the password will be exactly ~COUNT~.
